# Music-Genre-Classification-Using-Text-Mining

For my final project I read in a Kaggle dataset of music artists and their song lyrics for 6 different genres of music, and trained and tested machine learning models to predict what genre of music a certain song was based off their lyrics. Challenges of the dataset and alaysis included preprocessing, vectorizing the data, splitting the data, using hldout and cross validation teechniques, and applying Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines to do analysis. The categorical variable in the dataset was the "genre" field.
